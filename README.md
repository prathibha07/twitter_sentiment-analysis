Fine tuning BERT, using bert-base-uncased Â· Hugging Face pretrained model. This was taken from the Transformer model, part of the Hugging Face library trained on Book corpus + English Wikipedia using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective. BERT is a transformers model pre-trained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labeling them in any way with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. (Source: Hugging Face)
